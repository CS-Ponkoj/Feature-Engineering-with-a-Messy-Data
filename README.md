# Feature-Engineering-with-a-Messy-Data

Using the Ames Housing Data:

Dean De Cock Truman State University Journal of Statistics Education Volume 19, Number 3(2011), www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf

In this notebook, we will build some linear regression models to predict housing prices from this data. In particular, we will set out to improve on a baseline set of features via feature engineering: deriving new features from our existing data. Feature engineering often makes the difference between a weak model and a strong one.

We will use visual exploration, domain understanding, and intuition to construct new features that will be useful later in the course as we turn to prediction.
